# Introduction

## About the dataset
This analysis will explore a dataset on wine quality and physicochemical
properties. The objective is to explore which chemical properties influence the
quality of red wines.

The dataset contains red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Only 
physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available.

## Description of attributes:

1. fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not 
evaporate readily)

2. volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of 
levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3. citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and 
flavor to wines

4. residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's
rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 
grams/liter are considered sweet

5. chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

6. free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between 
molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial 
growth and the oxidation of wine

7. total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low 
concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 
concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8. density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the 
percent alcohol and sugar content

9. pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) 
to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10. sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) 
levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11. alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Summary of the dataset
Let's get a first glimpse on the available variables and their distribution
by plotting the Five-number summary extended by the mean.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Summary_of_dataset}
str(df)
summary(df)
```



# Univariate Plots Section

## Fixed Acidity
Defintion: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not 
evaporate readily).

```{r  fixed_acidity_plot}
qplot(df$fixed.acidity)+ 
  ggtitle('Fixed Acidity') +
  xlab('tartaric acid - g / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```
```{r  fixed_acidity_summary}
summary(df$fixed.acidity)
```

The fixed acidity is a right-skewed distribution, with a median of 7.9 g tartaric
acid per liter. There are some outliers that have more than 12 g/L up to a 
maximum of 15.9 g/L. The outliers will be plotted in the following.

```{r fixed_acidity_outliers}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = fixed.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(y = 'Fixed Acidity (g/L)', x = 'Count',
          title = "Fixed acidity distribution") 

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(y = fixed.acidity, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = 'blue') +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = 1, y = fixed.acidity), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = 'Fixed Acidity (g/L)', x = '',
          title = "Fixed acidity distribution") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```



## Volatile Acidity
Definition: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of  levels can
lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.


```{r  volatile_acidity_plot}
qplot(df$volatile.acidity)+ 
  ggtitle('Volatile Acidity') +
  xlab('acetic acid - g / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```
```{r  volatile_acidity_summary}
summary(df$volatile.acidity)
```

The volatile acidity is almost a symmetric distribution with a few positive 
outliers. The median and mean are ~5.2 g acetic acid per liter.
The distribuion of volatile acids is again skewed with outliers above 1.0 g/L up
to almost 1.6 g/L. The outliers will be plotted in the following.

```{r volatile_acidity_outliers}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = volatile.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(y = 'Volatile Acidity (g/L)', x = 'Count',
          title = "Volatile acidity distribution") 

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(y = volatile.acidity, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = 'blue') +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = 1, y = volatile.acidity), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = 'Volatile Acidity (g/L)', x = '',
          title = "Volatile acidity distribution") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

## Citric Acid
Definition: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and 
flavor to wines.

```{r  citric_acid_plot}
qplot(df$citric.acid)+ 
  ggtitle('Citric Acid') +
  xlab('g / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```
```{r  citric_acid_summary}
summary(df$citric.acid)
```
The citric acidity is a linear decreasing distribution with median of ~0.26 g 
citric acid per liter. Most of the wines (>150) do not contain any citric acid.
This distribution should be investigated for correlations later on!


## Residual Sugar
Definition: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it'srare to 
find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter
are considered sweet.

```{r  residual_sugar_plot}
qplot(df$residual.sugar)+ 
  ggtitle('Residual Sugar') +
  xlab('g / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```
```{r  residual_sugar_summary}
summary(df$residual.sugar)
```

Most of the red wines in the dataset contain between 1.9 and 2.5 grams sugar per
liter, while there is a long tail with wines that contain up to a maximum of 15 
grams sugar per liter. The outliers will be plotted in the following.

```{r residual_sugar_outliers}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = residual.sugar)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(y = 'Residual Sugar (g/L)', x = 'Count',
          title = "Residual Sugar distribution") 

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(y = residual.sugar, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = 'blue') +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = 1, y = residual.sugar), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = 'Residual Sugar (g/L)', x = '',
          title = "Residual Sugar distribution") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

## Chlorides
Definition: the amount of salt in the wine.
Most wines contain between 0.07 and 0.09 g of salt per liter. Again there is a 
long tail with wines containing up to 0.6 g of salt per liter.

```{r  chlorides_plot}
qplot(df$chlorides)+ 
  ggtitle('Chlorides') +
  xlab('sodium chloride - g / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  chlorides_summary}
summary(df$chlorides)
```

There are some wines that contain a lot more chlorides than the majority being 
closely to median of 0.08 they contain more than 0.1 g/L and can clearly be 
seen in the distribution histogram and boxplot. The outliers will be plotted in 
the following.

```{r chlorides_outliers}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = chlorides)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(y = 'Chlorides (g/L)', x = 'Count',
          title = "Chlorides distribution") 

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(y = chlorides, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = 'blue') +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = 1, y = chlorides), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = 'Chlorides (g/L)', x = '',
          title = "Chlorides distribution") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```


## Free Sulfur Dioxide
Definition: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 
(as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the 
oxidation of wine.

```{r  free_sulfur_dioxide_plot}
qplot(df$free.sulfur.dioxide)+ 
  ggtitle('Free Sulfur Dioxide') +
  xlab('mg / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  free_sulfur_dioxide_summary}
summary(df$free.sulfur.dioxide)
```

In the dataset the free sulfur dioxid is found in a right-skewed distribution, 
with an average of 16g per liter and 50% of the wines containing 7-21g per liter.
The few outliers will be plotted in the following.

```{r free_sulfur_dioxide_outliers}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  labs(y = 'Free sulfur dioxide (g/L)', x = 'Count',
          title = "Free sulfur dioxide distribution") 

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(y = free.sulfur.dioxide, x = 1)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = 'blue') +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = 1, y = free.sulfur.dioxide), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = 'Free sulfur dioxide (g/L)', x = '',
          title = "Free sulfur dioxide distribution") +
  coord_flip()

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```

## Total sulfur dioxide
Definition: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is
mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 
becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

The red wines contain at least 6 mg per liter and most wines (75%) contain no 
more than 62mg/l. The distribution is decreasing, with two very extreme outliers
with more than 250mg/l which will not be further investigated due to the low 
quantity.

```{r  total_sulfur_dioxide_plot}
qplot(df$total.sulfur.dioxide)+ 
  ggtitle('Total sulfur dioxide') +
  xlab('mg / dm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  total_sulfur_dioxide_summary}
summary(df$total.sulfur.dioxide)
```

## Density
Definition: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the 
percent alcohol and sugar content.

The density is normally distributed, with an average and mean ~1g/l.

```{r  density_plot}
qplot(df$density)+ 
  ggtitle('Density') +
  xlab('g / cm^3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  density_summary}
summary(df$density)
```

## pH Value
Definition: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very 
acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

The pH value is normally distributed, with a few positive and negative outliers.

```{r  pH_plot}
qplot(df$pH)+ 
  ggtitle('pH Value') +
  xlab('pH') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  pH_summary}
summary(df$pH)
```

## Sulphates
Definition: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) 
levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

```{r  sulphates_plot}
qplot(df$sulphates)+ 
  ggtitle('Sulphates') +
  xlab('potassium sulphate - g / dm3') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

```{r  sulphates_summary}
summary(df$sulphates)
```

Sulphates is a right skewed distribution. Most wines contain between 0.3 and 0.7
g/l - with only a few outliers ranging up to 2g/l which will be ignored for now.

## Alcohol
Definition: the percent alcohol content of the wine

```{r  alcohol_plot}
qplot(df$alcohol)+ 
  ggtitle('Alcohol') +
  xlab('% by volume') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```
```{r  alcohol_summary}
summary(df$alcohol)
```

Most wines contain between ~10% of alcohol. The distribution is skewed with more
wines containing more than 10% then lower percentage of alcohol.

## Quality
The output variable `quality` is ordinal, based on the median of at least 
3 evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between 
0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). As seen in the summary above, the output 
(median) `quality` of those ratings ranged only from 3 to 8, with a mean of 5.6 
and median of 6.

The experts moslty gave a rating of 5 or 6. Even though there are a more wines 
with a rating of 6 and higher than 5 and less the plot looks normally distributed.


```{r  quality_plot}
ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = df)+
       geom_bar()+
       xlab("Wine Quality rating") + ylab("Count") +
       ggtitle("Bar of Wine Quality")
```
```{r  quality_summary}
summary(df$quality)
```

## Rating
One new variable has been introducded: the rating. As the distrubution of the 
quality is mostly containing 5's and 6's and scatter below and above, the rating 
acts as a summary metric. By matching the quality in the 4 rating categories 
bad, OK, good & very good it can be used in further plots to reduce scatter 
without loosing too much detail.
The quality will be binned into the categories bad, OK, good and very good to
reduce the discussion of findings about the impact of variables on the quality 
to those 4 categories.
bad: quality below 5 
OK: quality is 5 
good: quality is 6
very good: quality is above 6

```{r  compute_rating}
df$rating <- ifelse(df$quality < 5, 'bad', ifelse(
  df$quality == 5, 'OK', ifelse(df$quality == 6, 'good', 'very good')))
df$rating <- ordered(df$rating,
                     levels = c('bad', 'OK', 'good', 'very good'))
summary(df$rating)
```


```{r  rating_plot}
qplot(df$rating)+ 
  ggtitle('Rating') +
  xlab('rating') +
  ylab('Number of Wines')
```

# Bivariate Plots Section

```{r echo=FALSE,boxplots}
get_bivariate_boxplot <- function(x, y, ylab) {
  return(qplot(data = df, x = x, y = y, geom = 'boxplot', ylab = ylab))

                                   'alcohol'),
             ncol = 4)

grid.arrange(get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$fixed.acidity,
                                   'fixed acidity'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$volatile.acidity,

             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), log10(df$residual.sugar),
                                   'residual sugar'),

                                   'free sulf. dioxide'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$total.sulfur.dioxide,
                                   'total sulf. dioxide'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$density,
                                   'density'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$pH,
                                   'pH'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), log10(df$sulphates),
                                   'sulphates'),
             get_bivariate_boxplot(factor(df$rating), df$alcohol,
                                   'alcohol'),
             ncol = 4)
```

The boxplots already hint towards some correlations:

Wines of higher quality have:

- high fixed acidity
- low volatile acitidy
- high citric acid
- low density
- low pH-value
- high sulphates
- high alcohol

The other variables do not seem to have an impact on the quality of the wine.

Futher investigation of correlation of the variables against quality should be 
done using `cor.test`:

```{r  calculate_correlation}
simple_cor_test <- function(x, y) {
  return(cor.test(x, as.numeric(y), method=("pearson"))$estimate)
}

correlations <- c(
  simple_cor_test(df$fixed.acidity, df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(df$volatile.acidity, df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(df$citric.acid, df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(df$density, df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(df$pH, df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(log10(df$sulphates), df$quality),
  simple_cor_test(df$alcohol, df$quality))
names(correlations) <- c('fixed.acidity', 'volatile.acidity', 'citric.acid',
                         'density', 'pH', 'log10.sulphates', 'alcohol')
correlations
```

The following variables have correlations to wine quality:

- alcohol
- volatile acidity
- sulphates
- citric acid
- density
- fixed acidity

The pH-value does not correlate with wine quality.

# Bivariate Analysis

The strongest correlation is between alcohol & quality which can be clearly seen
in the boxplot with an ascending quality with increasing alcohol level.
Also, following variables correlate with wine quality (in descending order):

- alcohol
- volatile acidity
- sulphates
- citric acid
- density
- fixed acidity

There are two main observations when investigating the correlation between those
variables:

1. Alcohol and density correlate negatively: the higher the alcohol the lower the
density. This can easily be explained with the lower density of alcohol compared
to water and if there is relatively more alcohol contained the density is thereby
lower.

2. Fixed acidity and density correlate positively: the higher the fixed acidity
the higher the density. This was suprising at first, as acidity does not 
correlate with the alcohol amount, which itself is correlating with the density.
After doing a little research it seems the acidity has a chemical effect on the 
density, thus the correlation

```

# Multivariate Analysis

The scatterplots examine the 6 variables we had identified correlating with the
quality of wines. To reduce the clutter, they are faceted by rating.
The volatile acidity appears to be rather low for a wine of good quality,no 
matter the amount of alcohol contained. Also the sulphate level & alcohol plot
show a picture of wines of good quality beeing concetrated in a smaller area 
around 11.8% alcohol and sulfate levels around 0.75.
When looking at the citric acid there is a very interesting gap of good wines at
0.25. Some of the wines that contain less were given a good quality rating by the
judges as well as mostly those above. All the wines that contain between 0.19 and
0.25 of citric acid are considered average or bad.

The boxplots show a very clear trend for citric acid as well as volatile acidity
on the qualtiy of red wine. Lower volatile acidity and higher citric acidity lead
to better wine quality. Those two forms of acid seem to cancel each other out,
as they're both influencing the fixed acidity and the pH value of the wine which
does not show a clear trend which could be linked to wine quality.

### Plot 2: Effect of Alcohol on Wine Quality
```{r  alcohol_quality}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = rating, y = alcohol,
                      color = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle('Alcohol Levels in Different Wine Qualities') +
  xlab('Quality') +
  ylab('Alcohol (% volume)')
```

### The effect of Alcohol on Wine Quality

Exploring the rating, the impact of alcohol volume becomes even clearer. 
These boxplots clearly show the effect of alcohol content on the quality of a 
wine. Even though there are outliers in the group of wines rated 'OK', in general
a higher amount of alcohol is an indicator for a wine of good quality. 

### Plot 3: What makes good wines, good, and bad wines, bad?
```{r  Plot_Three}
ggplot(data = df,
       aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = alcohol,
                      color = rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  
  ggtitle('Alcohol vs. Volatile Acidity and Wine Quality') +
  xlab('Volatile Acidity (g / dm^3)') +
  ylab('Alcohol (% volume)')
```

### Description Three
In this graph only the very good and bad wines had been considered after seeing 
the same trend not that clearly when considering wines with all types of rating.
This summarizes the strongest findings that were made:
For a wine to be of good quality, dependens on a low volatile acidity and a high
amount of alcohol contained.

# Reflection

The analysis of wine quality identified 6 different variables that correlate with
red wine quality: alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, citric acid, density and 
fixed acidity.
The alcohol contained as well as the volatile acidity are those variables that 
have the strongest impact on the red wine quality. Nonetheless it is imporant to
keep in mind that this dataset contains only wines of a certain region and there
could be regional differences that change the impact of e.g. volatile acidity on
red wines from Portugal compared to Australia.
As volatile acidity is hard to measure when buying a red wine, it might be worth
going for the red wine with higher alcohol amount the next time when in doubt of
which red wine to buy.
