# Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?
## About the dataset
This analysis is based on the dataset:
   P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis.
   Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.
   In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553. ISSN: 0167-9236.
The dataset is based on red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables
are available.The output variables are the median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
